# Notepad

My project is called "Notepad". Of course, there are many similar projects,
something worse or something better. I decided to make my project very simple and easy to learn, just as cool.
In this project, you are able to click a "Start" button.!!When you click the start button first window will close 
and the second one will open. Now, you just have to type anything on a notepad.After you wrote everything you want,
you can save your notes!Then you can just delete everything or maybe it will happen by accident.In this case, you always can return it back.I add Java IO to my project, every button you pressed will shown on the console of program, this case you will see what you pressed.
